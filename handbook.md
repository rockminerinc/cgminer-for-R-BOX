#The Handbook of R-BOX

###Preparation

#####**Choose a Wallet
You’d better register a wallet first, such as openblock.com and blockchain.info, which is online, then the address generated by it can be used to receive mining pool profits, or you can just use the address of your local wallet to receive profits. However, address in online exchange(s) are not suggested to receive profit for security.

2FA code (such as being generated by GAuth.), cell phone and security email are VERY VERY important to login and recover of your account.

* Change mining pool and wallet address. The default pool address of this cgminer version is eligius, that means you can just change wallet address to be yours if you are going to use eligius.

###### Very important: If the mining pool is not eligius, you should follow pools’ rule to set specs.

* Set chips working frequence. The effective range of working frequence is 270M, and you should save .txt when frequence’s been changed.
